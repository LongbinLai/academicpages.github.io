This paper studied the subgraph enumeration problem using MapReduce. In this paper, a special structure called TwinTwig has been used in the left-deep join structure and proven to be instance-optimal compared to the traditional join based on star. The source code can be forked from here [GitHub pages](https://github.com/longbin-lai/SubgEnumFramework).
