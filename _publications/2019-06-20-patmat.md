This paper systematically compares the existing works on distributed subgraph matching algorithms in the literature. It summarizes the literature into four strategies: BinJoin (binary-join-based subgraph growing algorithms), WOptJoin (worst-case optimal vertex growing algorithms), ShrCube (Sharing of Hypercubes) and FulRep (Full replica of graph data in each machine). We are currently working on open sourcing the codes. Please stay tuned!
