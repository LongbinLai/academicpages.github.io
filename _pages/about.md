I obtained my Degree of Bachelor and Master from Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU) in 2010 and 2013 respectively. After that, I joined the Database group in CSE, UNSW, Sydney for Ph.D study. I obtained my Ph.D degree in Mar., 2017. Currently I am a PostDoc researcher in CSE, UNSW, Sydney. My research interests include graph algorithms, graph database, database management, distributed algorithms and systems. 

I like playing guitar, and ocasionally I write some pieces of folk music. My another big hobby is hiking, and most of the time I hike along the seacoast. Sydney is a beautiful place to hike and to experience.
